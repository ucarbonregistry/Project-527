The project aims to manufacture Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (AAC) blocks, a sustainable alternative
to traditional red clay bricks. These blocks are produced using fly ash/sand, cement, lime, aluminium
powder, and water, undergoing a chemical reaction and high-pressure steam curing (autoclaving),
resulting in lightweight, durable building material with excellent insulation properties.

Purpose of the project activity:
The main objective of the project is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by displacing carbon-intensive
red clay bricks with energy-efficient and eco-friendly AAC blocks. This shift leads to:
● Avoidance of emissions associated with coal combustion in brick kilns.
● Conservation of topsoil used in traditional brick manufacturing.
● Utilization of industrial by-products (fly ash), reducing waste.

The plant is owned by Starbigbloc Building Material Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bigbloc
Construction Ltd., one of India’s leading AAC block manufacturers with over 13 years of experience.
The facility is state-of-the-art, using modern equipment and fully automated processes to ensure quality,
efficiency, and compliance with green building norms.
The installed capacity is approximately 2,50,000 cubic meters per annum of AAC blocks which
includes sand based AAC . These blocks are marketed under the “NXTBloc” brand and serve a range
of infrastructure sectors including residential, commercial, and industrial projects.
